## ✅ Claiming Your Subreddit: Instructions

### Step-by-Step

1. Create an account on [SubHarbor](https://subharbor.com/login) — you can use email or OAuth with Discord or Google.

2. Verify your Reddit account so you can authenticate that you are a moderator of the subreddit. ([via the dashboard](https://subharbor.com/dashboard))

- Choose your verification method:

  - **OAuth Login** (recommended)
  - **Reddit DM to [u/SubHarborBot](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SubHarborBot&subject=Verification&message=Please%20verify%20my%20SubHarbor%20account.)** (for those who don’t want to OAuth)

3. Search for the subreddit using the search function in the top-right corner or typing it in or selecting it on the dashboard after you've verified your Reddit account.

- Click **"Claim This Sub"** (visible to logged-in users on unclaimed subreddits).
  - If this is not visible, that means the page has already been claimed by another moderator. You can claim the subreddit via the [Dashboard](https://subharbor.com/dashboard)

4. Once verified, add any of the following links:

   - Discord
   - Lemmy
   - Kbin
   - RSS Feed
   - Website or blog
   - Twitter / Mastodon / Bluesky

5. Click **Save**

### Tips

- Use clean, direct links. Avoid shorteners.
- No login is required for users to browse your profile.
- You can come back and edit your links anytime.
