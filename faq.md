## ðŸ“š FAQ: SubHarbor

### What is SubHarbor?

SubHarbor is a lightweight backup directory for Reddit communities. If your subreddit has a Discord, Lemmy mirror, or other off-Reddit presence, SubHarbor gives your members a way to find it â€” especially in the event of Reddit outages, API restrictions, or shutdowns.

### Is SubHarbor open source?

Not currently. The platform is very simple under the hood and could be open-sourced in the future, but for now, itâ€™s closed-source. However, the public API may be documented for limited usage.

### Is this official Reddit infrastructure?

No. This is an independent project with no affiliation to Reddit.

### How do I prove Iâ€™m a mod?

You can:

1. **Use Reddit OAuth** during claim â€” this is the quickest method. It only requests read-only access to confirm your mod status. Nothing is posted on your behalf.
2. **DM our Reddit bot**: If you prefer not to OAuth, you can verify your identity by messaging **[u/SubHarborBot](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SubHarborBot&subject=Verification&message=Please%20verify%20my%20SubHarbor%20account.)**. The dashboard will pre-fill the message for you.
