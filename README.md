# SubHarbor

🔗 **[Visit SubHarbor.com](https://subharbor.com)**

SubHarbor helps subreddit communities share trusted external links — like Discords, forums, RSS feeds, or Lemmy/Kbin mirrors — in case Reddit becomes restricted or inaccessible.

This repo contains public-facing info about the service: how it works, how to get listed, and where to go if Reddit goes down.

## 📌 What Is SubHarbor?

A public, lightweight directory where Reddit communities can register and share their backup homes.

- Designed to be dead-simple
- No logins required to browse
- No ads or invasive tracking
